# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this README aggregates the essential project management resources for OctoAcme. It provides a concise overview of our processes and direct links to the canonical process documents so new and existing team members can quickly find guidance and follow consistent practices.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows an iterative, cross-functional approach focused on rapid value delivery, clear alignment, and continuous improvement:

- Business alignment and clear goals
  - Projects start with explicit business objectives and stakeholder alignment (see Project Initiation Guide).
- Planning and prioritization
  - Work is planned using a prioritized backlog, with well-defined, actionable deliverables and acceptance criteria.
- Execution and tracking
  - Progress is tracked frequently with short feedback cycles, regular demos, and defined quality gates.
- Risk and communication
  - Risk is identified and managed early; communication plans keep stakeholders informed and decisions auditable.
- Releases and incidents
  - Releases follow a standardized checklist and deployment playbook; incident playbooks define roles and steps for fast recovery.
- Continuous improvement
  - Retrospectives capture actionable improvements and feed them back into planning and process updates.
- Roles and responsibilities
  - Clear role definitions (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, Stakeholders) reduce ambiguity and speed decision-making.
